# ✅ FIXED: Order Summary Now Shows Properly!

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Problem
When users said "I take one", the bot would ask for info and then immediately try to finalize the order WITHOUT showing an order summary.

### Solution
1. **Order confirmation now happens BEFORE AI generation** - prevents AI from generating its own confirmation messages
2. **Added support for comma-separated info** - handles "name, phone, address" in one message
3. **ORDER SUMMARY always shows** before final confirmation

## 📋 New Complete Flow

### For New Customers:

```

      What's your full name?"

[Then continues with normal flow asking for phone, email, address]
```

## 🔧 Key Improvements

1. ✅ **ORDER SUMMARY always appears** before final confirmation
2. ✅ **Supports comma-separated input** - users can provide all info at once
3. ✅ **Checks for existing customers** - no need to re-enter info
4. ✅ **Clear two-step confirmation**:
   - Step 1: Review order summary → YES
   - Step 2: Final confirmation → YES
   - Then saves to database
5. ✅ **Easy to edit** - users can say EDIT at any time

## 📊 Database Storage

After final confirmation, the order is saved to:
- `customers` table - customer info
- `orders` table - order record with total
- `order_items` table - individual items

You can check in Supabase to see all orders being stored properly!
